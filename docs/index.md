The **Brain Harmonization Tool (HAIL)** is a free, open-source web-based application
designed at [Children's National Hospital](https://www.childrensnational.org/) 
for the harmonization of brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). 
Developed in Python, this software aims to be used as a preprocssing tool to provide precise quantitative analysis of brain MRI and support clinical decision-making in diagnosis and prognosis.  

# Usage

This software currently functions on the t1 MRI sequences: native pre-contrast T1-weighted (t1n) and  
contrast-enhanced T1-weighted (t1c). These sequences should be 
uploaded in NIfTI format (*i.e.*, **.nii.gz**). Before uploading, 
we strongly recommend performing **de-identification** to remove any protected 
health information, including **defacing** if necessary. 

**Pre-processing** in the harmonization is under development. At this time, 
we expect users to  resample the inputs to an isotropic 1 mm resolution of 192x224x192.  

Once the MRI sequences are uploaded, select the uploaded modality from the dropdown and click the **Start Harmonization** button. 
The process typically takes around 8 minutes. Afterward, the MRI 
sequence before and after harmonization is visualized on axial, coronal, and sagittal views using the interactive **Sliders**. Harmonization results can be downloaded in 
NIfTI format by clicking the **Download Harmonized File** button.  

For **demonstration** purposes, we provide sample cases at the bottom of the page. 
Select one and click the **Start Harmonization** button to see how the software works.
