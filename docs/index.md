The **Pediatric Brain Tumor Segmenter** is a free, open-source web-based application
designed at [Children's National Hospital](https://www.childrensnational.org/) 
for the segmentation and analysis of pediatric brain tumors in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). 
Developed in Python, this software aims to provide precise quantitative analysis 
of pediatric brain MRI, to support clinical decision-making in diagnosis and prognosis.  

With its user-friendly interface, the Segmenter provides automated segmentation 
and volumetric measurements within minutes after uploading the required four MRI sequences. 
This software provides **state-of-the-art performance** powered by our benchmarked 
segmentation model, which was the **top-performing model** in the pediatric competition of the 
well-established international Brain Tumor Segmentation Challenge 
[BraTS2023](https://www.synapse.org/Synapse:syn51156910/wiki/627802).  

# Usage

This software currently requires four MRI sequences: native pre-contrast T1-weighted (t1n), 
contrast enhanced T1-weighted (t1c), native T2-weighted (t2w), and 
T2-weighted fluid attenuated inversion recovery (t2f). These sequences should be 
uploaded in NIfTI format (*i.e.*, **.nii.gz**). Before uploading, 
we strongly recommend performing **de-identification** to remove any protected 
health information, including **defacing** if necessary. 

**Pre-processing** in the Segmenter is under development. At this time, 
we expect users to follow the standardized ["BraTS Pipeline"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.15009) 
pre-processing, which includes co-registration of four sequences, and resampling to isotropic 1 mm resolution.  
Public tools such as the Cancer Imaging Phenomics Toolkit ([CaPTk](https://github.com/CBICA/CaPTk)) 
and Federated Tumor Segmentation ([FeTS](https://fets-ai.github.io/Front-End/process_data)) 
toolkits can be used for this purpose.  

Once the MRI sequences are uploaded, simply click the **Start Segmentation** button 
to generate segmentation and volumetric measurements in the **Status** box. 
The process typically takes around 8 minutes. Afterward, you can choose an MRI 
sequence to visualize both the image and the segmentation in axial, coronal, and sagittal views 
using the interactive **Sliders**. Segmentation results can be downloaded in 
NIfTI format by clicking the **Download Segmentation File** button.  

For **demonstration** purposes, we provide sample cases at the bottom of the page. 
Select one and click the **Start Segmentation** button to see how the software works.
