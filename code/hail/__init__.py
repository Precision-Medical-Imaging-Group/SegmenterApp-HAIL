### API Documentation for Pediatric MR-T1 Harmonizer

Welcome to the API documentation for the code. Navigate through the table of contents on the left to explore detailed documentation for each submodule.

This project develops the **Pediatric Brain MR-T1 Harmonization**, a free, open-source web-based application
designed at [Children's National Hospital](https://www.childrensnational.org/) as part of the [HOPE platform](https://docs.hope4kids.io/HOPE-Platform/) 
for the segmentation and analysis of pediatric brain tumors in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Developed in Python, this software aims to provide tools for harmonizing pediatric brain MRI, to support clinical decision-making in diagnosis and prognosis.  The software and instructions are available at [hail.hope4kids.io](https://hail.hope4kids.io/) and [instructions](https://docs.hope4kids.io/SegmenterApp-HAIL/).
